# Contributing

You are welcome to contribute to this project :)

This is a hobby project to see how React can be used to create a game.

You can contribute by opening issues, suggesting ideas, reporting bugs, implementing new features, improving the codebase, fixing typos, or in any other way you can think of.

## Pull Request Process

1. Pull the latest changes of the development branch and create a branch to work with.
2. Once your changes are ready, push your branch with your new commits and create a Pull Request into `development` (the default branch in this repo). Include a description that explains what your PR does.
3. Maintainers will review your PR as soon as possible.
